            <title><![CDATA[Elementary school]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Elementary school</h1><p>This project addresses the design of an elementary school in
Athens, Greece. The building includes twelve classrooms, a
library, a restaurant, office spaces and a hall for multiple uses.
On the ground floor movements are organized with a route
that begins on the east side of the plot, and continues,
covering every classroom, giving shape to the atrium in the
middle, and finally arriving to the tower, which is used as a
canteen. The main objective is the formation of an atrium
which would directly relate to every classroom and function
as a gathering space for the children during collective
activities. Great emphasis is given to the design of the
multifunctional interspaces of the building, in order to
produce meeting places for the students and a variety of
spaces from the closed, to the semi-open, and finally to the
open spaces. The school uses the adjacent empty plots of the
urban web for recreational activities. In the same way, the
open spaces of the school become multifunctional spaces for
the local community during the evening. Two main open
spaces are designed,. These are the encircled atrium and the
big open space that has direct relation with the restaurant,
the library and the inclined terrace of the underground hall of
multiple uses. The design of the underground hall of multiple
uses smoothly defines the boundaries between the school
and the urban web on the ground level.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6cf1bf5b1f6f221c3447fdac42d70e5daa788c9c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[TV Tower]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>TV Tower</h1><p>Reconstruction of the unfinished TV tower and its' adjacent
territory in Yekaterinburg, Russia. The proposal aims to
redesign the abandoned TV tower of 220m height, to a new
building complex with recreational uses. The new
construction reaches 500m and becomes a powerful
landmark for the city. It becomes one of the tallest structures
in Russia and attracts many visitors and further investments.
On the ground level, visitors can enjoy an indoor tropical
landscape, use the hot water baths and the pools that work
all year round. Ice skating rinks are positioned outdoors.
Other uses include a congress center, an exhibition hall and a
hotel. The inflatable structure is superimposed on the existing
tower and an elevator can lift 300 people up to 500m high,
where they can enjoy the panoramic city view. Hot water and
hot air are the elements that form this landmark at an
affordable cost. The original tower was expected to reach
360m height. The proposal aims to improve to 500m. The city
of Yekaterinburg will become one of the 12 places in the world
which have had the power to erect structures over 500m
height, thus making its presence in the world grow
exponentially. The strategy is to create an inflatable
structure, a vertical aerostatic balloon that uses the existing
structure as its launching platform. Hot air and hot water
become the elements that give origin to the coolest city in
this part of the world.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/df06d86d38d1fef0e2a24d1a809ac13e76e06392.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Transformable surface]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Transformable surface</h1><p>Design of an interactive transformable surface which is able
to bend out of plane and scale at the same time. The surface
can be applied as a building facade skin or an interior space
partition and can interact to various stimuli, such as
temperature, air and light. The interactive surface can be
used in order to augment the acoustic experience of a space,
or control lighting, by changing it’s geometry and
permeability. In order to control the interaction of the skin
with external stimuli, sensors are placed on the surface and
mechanical parts force it to transform accordingly. The
prototype fabrication process focused on the design of the
ball and socket joints which connect the parts together and
allow for certain degrees of freedom. Finally, great
importance was given to the overall structural stability of the
surface and the way it can be attached to a building facade.
We applied molding and casting techniques using liquid
plastics in order to create the joints of the prototype. The
materials of the petals is pvc together with plywood.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/14713bd121d2d65097cc0b56820b2e47c2b7c1d8.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[City Home]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>City Home</h1><p>The cost to live in an urban area is increasingly out of reach
for young professionals. With scarcity of space, cost to rent
or buy is escalating whilst the standard of living is
compromised. The transformable city-home takes
advantage of a clever arrangement of simple mechanical
systems to allow for many different uses of a single space –
fit for young professionals with similarly flexible lifestyles. In
doing so, the overall living space can be compacted into a
simple 15 x 15 feet micro unit, allowing the space to be
s imul ta neous l y luxur ious a nd a f fordabl e . The
transformability comes in the form of a thickened ceiling
from which different surfaces can descend, transforming the
small unit from one activity to another without taking any
floor space. The City Home takes advantage of the fact that
many activities can be available on demand, instead of
taking up space in the home at all times. Only the kitchen
and bathroom are relatively fixed and available at any given
moment. This creates a flexible building system where
different 'activities' can be installed into the ceiling based
upon the needs and preferences of each tenant, while the
building structure and chassis never needs to change. The
drop ceiling of the room maximizes the space efficiency of
the room and makes it possible to have the highest flexibility.
The largest pieces of furniture – the bed and the worktable
can be elevated and hidden above the drop ceiling during
day time to make the room space clear for other activities.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4dbc7f4b964a5d4d2cf7afab6ee24a2fa3f84f54.jpg"></article>]]></description>
