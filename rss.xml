            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>MIXED USE</h1><p>Masterplan for housing and commercial spaces development in the region of Tavros, Athens, Greece. The plot is located on a busy traffic node and the proposal re-organizes the pedestrian and vehicular movements in the area. Commercial and recreational uses are placed on the ground floor and housing units are placed above them. Particular emphasis is given in the configuration of residences, aiming at variety and the changing relation of communal and private spaces each time. The proposal organizes a second level of public space for the local residents. It is located six meters above the street level in order to protect them from the adjacent noisy highway. Configuration of an interior open space, running along the residential units, aiming at their side to side arrangement; the sufficient ventilation and natural lighting of all the apartments, as well as the creation of an introvert network of daily meeting and communication for residents. The designed open spaces are organized on three scales - the small private spaces which belong to each apartment, the medium sized communal spaces which act as a cohesive tool for multiple apartments, and the main open squares. The design aimed for a unique space experience. In this way, the residents do not live in one of the anonymous, repeating units of a block. They possess a unique space, recognizable and distinctive from the others.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/aa9ee1ba6226a4d048e5db50ca9a859d25ce4820.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[ELEMENTARY SCHOOL]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>ELEMENTARY SCHOOL</h1><p>This project addresses the design of an elementary school in Athens, Greece. The building includes twelve classrooms, a library, a restaurant, office spaces and a hall for multiple uses. On the ground floor movements are organized with a route that begins on the east side of the plot, and continues, covering every classroom, giving shape to the atrium in the middle, and finally arriving to the tower, which is used as a canteen. The main objective is the formation of an atrium which would directly relate to every classroom and function as a gathering space for the children during collective activities. Great emphasis is given to the design of the multifunctional interspaces of the building, in order to produce meeting places for the students and a variety of spaces from the closed, to the semi-open, and finally to the open spaces. The school uses the adjacent empty plots of the urban web for recreational activities. In the same way, the open spaces of the school become multifunctional spaces for the local community during the evening. Two main open spaces are designed,. These are the encircled atrium and the big open space that has direct relation with the restaurant, the library and the inclined terrace of the underground hall of multiple uses. The design of the underground hall of multiple uses smoothly defines the boundaries between the school and the urban web on the ground level.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6cf1bf5b1f6f221c3447fdac42d70e5daa788c9c.jpg"></article>]]></description>
