            <title><![CDATA[MIXED USE]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>MIXED USE</h1><p>Masterplan for housing and commercial spaces development in the region of Tavros, Athens, Greece. The plot is located on a busy traffic node and the proposal re-organizes the pedestrian and vehicular movements in the area. Commercial and recreational uses are placed on the ground floor and housing units are placed above them. Particular emphasis is given in the configuration of residences, aiming at variety and the changing relation of communal and private spaces each time. The proposal organizes a second level of public space for the local residents. It is located six meters above the street level in order to protect them from the adjacent noisy highway. Configuration of an interior open space, running along the residential units, aiming at their side to side arrangement; the sufficient ventilation and natural lighting of all the apartments, as well as the creation of an introvert network of daily meeting and communication for residents. The designed open spaces are organized on three scales - the small private spaces which belong to each apartment, the medium sized communal spaces which act as a cohesive tool for multiple apartments, and the main open squares. The design aimed for a unique space experience. In this way, the residents do not live in one of the anonymous, repeating units of a block. They possess a unique space, recognizable and distinctive from the others.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/aa9ee1ba6226a4d048e5db50ca9a859d25ce4820.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[RE – PROVIDENCE]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The project aims to develop a dense urban fabric in the
center of Providence, Rhode Island and connect it with the
adjacent areas, which have been developed according to the
suburban sprawl model. The proposal focuses on three
different scales. The Urban scale, the Neighborhood scale
and finally the Street scale. On the Urban scale, three linear
infrastructure axes cross the center of Providence and
expand into the suburban areas. These axes organize a
sequence of free public spaces together with commercial
and recreational uses along them. They become poles of
attraction both to the local community and visitors from
other areas. The linear infrastructure provides the means for
transportation, both for pedestrians and vehicles. On the
Neighborhood plan, a small scale urban block typology is
applied in the plan, in order to infill the existing urban voids
and create new walk able neighborhoods. Three street
typologies are used in the plan. Great emphasis is given to
the pedestrian street network which connects the public
spaces. The street scale proposal includes the design of the
buildings’ facades and the guidelines for their overall
dimensions and number of built floors, in order to create a
unified experience of urban space. The master plan
reconstructs the city center and aims to reform the
surrounding suburbia in the future. It accommodates 15.000
more inhabitants in the city center than the existing plan.</p>]]></description>
