  Design of an interactive transformable surface which is able
  to bend out of plane and scale at the same time. The surface
  can be applied as a building facade skin or an interior space
  partition and can interact to various stimuli, such as
  temperature, air and light. The interactive surface can be
  used in order to augment the acoustic experience of a space,
  or control lighting, by changing itâ€™s geometry and
  permeability. In order to control the interaction of the skin
  with external stimuli, sensors are placed on the surface and
  mechanical parts force it to transform accordingly. The
  prototype fabrication process focused on the design of the
  ball and socket joints which connect the parts together and
  allow for certain degrees of freedom. Finally, great
  importance was given to the overall structural stability of the
  surface and the way it can be attached to a building facade.
  We applied molding and casting techniques using liquid
  plastics in order to create the joints of the prototype. The
  materials of the petals is pvc together with plywood.
