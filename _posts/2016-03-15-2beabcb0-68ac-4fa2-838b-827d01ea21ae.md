### Transformable surface

Design of an interactive transformable surface which is able to bend out of plane and scale at the same time. The surface can be applied as a building facade skin or an interior space partition and can interact to various stimuli, such as temperature, air and light. The interactive surface can be used in order to augment the acoustic experience of a space, or control lighting, by changing it's geometry and permeability. In order to control the interaction of the skin with external stimuli, sensors are placed on the surface and mechanical parts force it to transform accordingly. The prototype fabrication process focused on the design of the ball and socket joints which connect the parts together and allow for certain degrees of freedom. Finally, great importance was given to the overall structural stability of the surface and the way it can be attached to a building facade. We applied molding and casting techniques using liquid plastics in order to create the joints of the prototype. The materials of the petals is pvc together with plywood.
