  Design of an aluminum kiosk, able to fit in different types of public spaces
  in the city of Athens and accommodate different uses according to different
  scenarios. It can operate as a product selling point or an information kiosk.
  It can adapt to most types of urban open spaces and withstand all climate
  conditions. The folding sheath can acquire multiple forms and accommodate
  different uses. It can be used for suspending posters, products or even
  vegetation. Advertisements can be placed on the top of the kiosk. Multiple
  intermediary spaces are formulated through the transformative nature of the
  Box, thus becoming an transformative element of the urban space. Here,
  function shapes form. In-out possesses a profusely protean nature, reinforcing
  the social consistency of Mediterranean societies. Indefinite and socially
  vibrant spaces are generated. A multiform, fragile, plural and ephemeral
  space. The double exterior surface of the construction generates satisfactory
  variable spaces between the sleeve and the inside core. The distorted yet
  rational form of the kiosk allows access from all sides. The metal perforated
  surface can sustain interventions when placed in an urban environment, without
  dissolving the construction's overall aesthetic quality. The physical scale
  prototype was exhibited at the Benaki Museum, Athens. The design competition
  was organized by the Hellenic Institute of Architecture and the sponsor of the
  construction was the Aluminum Association of Greece.
