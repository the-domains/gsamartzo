  Design of an aluminum kiosk, able to fit in different types of
  public spaces in the city of Athens and accommodate
  different uses according to different scenarios. It can operate
  as a product selling point or an information kiosk. It can
  adapt to most types of urban open spaces and withstand all
  climate conditions. The folding sheath can acquire multiple
  forms and accommodate different uses. It can be used for
  suspending posters, products or even vegetation.
  Advertisements can be placed on the top of the kiosk.
  Multiple intermediary spaces are formulated through the
  transformative nature of the Box, thus becoming an
  transformative element of the urban space. Here, function
  shapes form. In-out possesses a profusely protean nature,
  reinforcing the social consistency of Mediterranean societies.
  Indefinite and socially vibrant spaces are generated. A
  multiform, fragile, plural and ephemeral space. The double
  exterior surface of the construction generates satisfactory
  variable spaces between the sleeve and the inside core. The
  distorted yet rational form of the kiosk allows access from all
  sides. The metal perforated surface can sustain interventions
  when placed in an urban environment, without dissolving the
  construction's overall aesthetic quality. The physical scale
  prototype was exhibited at the Benaki Museum, Athens. The
  design competition was organized by the Hellenic Institute of
  Architecture and the sponsor of the construction was the
  Aluminum Association of Greece.
