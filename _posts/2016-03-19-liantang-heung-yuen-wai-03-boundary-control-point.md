Boundary control point

Masterplan for the boundary control point between the Shenzhen territory, China and Hong Kong. The proposal aims to reform the existing landscape and design an independent island which accommodates logistics and market spaces and an extensive vehicular mobility infrastructure. All these spaces are placed under the large scale roof. They are organized on different levels and have direct access to the wild ecosystem that lies above them. The exterior surface of the structure aims to extend the existing landscape which is subject to destruction due to the extensive pollution in the area. The proposal suggests the creation of four different zones of landscape which respond to the existing flora in the territory. The interior space includes technological equipment for the production of energy and the absorption of air pollution. The infrastructure becomes energy efficient by using piezoelectric systems, solar panels and taking advantage of the changes of the temperature of the river. As an example, the piezoelectric technology system produces 1.5MW from the average 30.000 vehicles that pass through the territory everyday. The air pollutants from the vehicles are absorbed from the exterior surface which includes specific types of flora and bacteria. Finally, the proposal aims to redefine the boundary conditions between the two countries with the design of an independent island which improves the mobility of people and the exchange of goods.
