  Masterplan for the boundary control point between the
  Shenzhen territory, China and Hong Kong. The proposal aims
  to reform the existing landscape and design an independent
  island which accommodates logistics and market spaces
  and an extensive vehicular mobility infrastructure. All these
  spaces are placed under the large scale roof. They are
  organized on different levels and have direct access to the
  wild ecosystem that lies above them. The exterior surface of
  the structure aims to extend the existing landscape which is
  subject to destruction due to the extensive pollution in the
  area. The proposal suggests the creation of four different
  zones of landscape which respond to the existing flora in the
  territory. The interior space includes technological equipment
  for the production of energy and the absorption of air
  pollution. The infrastructure becomes energy efficient by
  using piezoelectric systems, solar panels and taking
  advantage of the changes of the temperature of the river. As
  an example, the piezoelectric technology system produces
  1.5MW from the average 30.000 vehicles that pass through
  the territory everyday. The air pollutants from the vehicles are
  absorbed from the exterior surface which includes specific
  types of flora and bacteria. Finally, the proposal aims to
  redefine the boundary conditions between the two countries
  with the design of an independent island which improves the
  mobility of people and the exchange of goods.
