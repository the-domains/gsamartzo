  The cost to live in an urban area is increasingly out of reach
  for young professionals. With scarcity of space, cost to rent
  or buy is escalating whilst the standard of living is
  compromised. The transformable city-home takes
  advantage of a clever arrangement of simple mechanical
  systems to allow for many different uses of a single space –
  fit for young professionals with similarly flexible lifestyles. In
  doing so, the overall living space can be compacted into a
  simple 15 x 15 feet micro unit, allowing the space to be
  s imul ta neous l y luxur ious a nd a f fordabl e . The
  transformability comes in the form of a thickened ceiling
  from which different surfaces can descend, transforming the
  small unit from one activity to another without taking any
  floor space. The City Home takes advantage of the fact that
  many activities can be available on demand, instead of
  taking up space in the home at all times. Only the kitchen
  and bathroom are relatively fixed and available at any given
  moment. This creates a flexible building system where
  different 'activities' can be installed into the ceiling based
  upon the needs and preferences of each tenant, while the
  building structure and chassis never needs to change. The
  drop ceiling of the room maximizes the space efficiency of
  the room and makes it possible to have the highest flexibility.
  The largest pieces of furniture – the bed and the worktable
  can be elevated and hidden above the drop ceiling during
  day time to make the room space clear for other activities.
