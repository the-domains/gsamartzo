City Home

The cost to live in an urban area is increasingly out of reach for young professionals. With scarcity of space, cost to rent or buy is escalating whilst the standard of living is compromised. The transformable city-home takes advantage of a clever arrangement of simple mechanical systems to allow for many different uses of a single space -- fit for young professionals with similarly flexible lifestyles. In doing so, the overall living space can be compacted into a simple 15 x 15 feet micro unit, allowing the space to be simultaneously luxurious and affordable . The transformability comes in the form of a thickened ceiling from which different surfaces can descend, transforming the small unit from one activity to another without taking any floor space. The City Home takes advantage of the fact that many activities can be available on demand, instead of taking up space in the home at all times. Only the kitchen and bathroom are relatively fixed and available at any given moment. This creates a flexible building system where different 'activities' can be installed into the ceiling based upon the needs and preferences of each tenant, while the building structure and chassis never needs to change. The drop ceiling of the room maximizes the space efficiency of the room and makes it possible to have the highest flexibility. The largest pieces of furniture -- the bed and the worktable can be elevated and hidden above the drop ceiling during day time to make the room space clear for other activities.
