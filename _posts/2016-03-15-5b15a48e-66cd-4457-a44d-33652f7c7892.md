  Masterplan for housing and commercial spaces development
  in the region of Tavros, Athens, Greece. The plot is located on
  a busy traffic node and the proposal re-organizes the
  pedestrian and vehicular movements in the area.
  Commercial and recreational uses are placed on the ground
  floor and housing units are placed above them. Particular
  emphasis is given in the configuration of residences, aiming
  at variety and the changing relation of communal and
  private spaces each time. The proposal organizes a second
  level of public space for the local residents. It is located six
  meters above the street level in order to protect them from
  the adjacent noisy highway. Configuration of an interior
  open space, running along the residential units, aiming at
  their side to side arrangement; the sufficient ventilation and
  natural lighting of all the apartments, as well as the creation
  of an introvert network of daily meeting and communication
  for residents. The designed open spaces are organized on
  three scales - the small private spaces which belong to each
  apartment, the medium sized communal spaces which act
  as a cohesive tool for multiple apartments, and the main
  open squares. The design aimed for a unique space
  experience. In this way, the residents do not live in one of the
  anonymous, repeating units of a block. They possess a
  unique space, recognizable and distinctive from the others.
