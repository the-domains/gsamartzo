  organized on three scales - the small private spaces which belong to each
  apartment, the medium sized communal spaces which act as a cohesive tool for
  multiple apartments, and the main open squares. The design aimed for a unique
  space experience. In this way, the residents do not live in one of the
  anonymous, repeating units of a block. They possess a unique space,
  recognizable and distinctive from the others.
