Reconstruction of the unfinished TV tower and its' adjacent territory in Yekaterinburg, Russia. The proposal aims to redesign the abandoned TV tower of 220m height, to a new building complex with recreational uses. The new construction reaches 500m and becomes a powerful landmark for the city. It becomes one of the tallest structures in Russia and attracts many visitors and further investments. On the ground level, visitors can enjoy an indoor tropical landscape, use the hot water baths and the pools that work all year round. Ice skating rinks are positioned outdoors. Other uses include a congress center, an exhibition hall and a hotel. The inflatable structure is superimposed on the existing tower and an elevator can lift 300 people up to 500m high, where they can enjoy the panoramic city view. Hot water and hot air are the elements that form this landmark at an affordable cost. The original tower was expected to reach 360m height. The proposal aims to improve to 500m. The city of Yekaterinburg will become one of the 12 places in the world which have had the power to erect structures over 500m height, thus making its presence in the world grow exponentially. The strategy is to create an inflatable structure, a vertical aerostatic balloon that uses the existing structure as its launching platform. Hot air and hot water become the elements that give origin to the coolest city in this part of the world.
