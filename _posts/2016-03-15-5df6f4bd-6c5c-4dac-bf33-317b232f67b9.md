  Reconstruction of the unfinished TV tower and its' adjacent
  territory in Yekaterinburg, Russia. The proposal aims to
  redesign the abandoned TV tower of 220m height, to a new
  building complex with recreational uses. The new
  construction reaches 500m and becomes a powerful
  landmark for the city. It becomes one of the tallest structures
  in Russia and attracts many visitors and further investments.
  On the ground level, visitors can enjoy an indoor tropical
  landscape, use the hot water baths and the pools that work
  all year round. Ice skating rinks are positioned outdoors.
  Other uses include a congress center, an exhibition hall and a
  hotel. The inflatable structure is superimposed on the existing
  tower and an elevator can lift 300 people up to 500m high,
  where they can enjoy the panoramic city view. Hot water and
  hot air are the elements that form this landmark at an
  affordable cost. The original tower was expected to reach
  360m height. The proposal aims to improve to 500m. The city
  of Yekaterinburg will become one of the 12 places in the world
  which have had the power to erect structures over 500m
  height, thus making its presence in the world grow
  exponentially. The strategy is to create an inflatable
  structure, a vertical aerostatic balloon that uses the existing
  structure as its launching platform. Hot air and hot water
  become the elements that give origin to the coolest city in
  this part of the world.
