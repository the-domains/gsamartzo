  This project addresses design strategies for the future
  development of drosscapes in urban regions and their
  relation with the city at large, having as an example the
  district of Eleonas in Athens, Greece. It provides answers to
  the problems of the district and understands the drosscape
  as a potential for the urban revitalization of the city of
  Athens. The design proposal is primarily concerned with the
  urban transformation of the drosscape, and not its ecological
  reclamation. To do so, the proposal focuses in multiple scales
  of analysis and proposals. Eleonas is a huge area covering
  approximately 2.350 acres. It is located within walking
  distance from the historical center of Athens, while at the
  same time it is the biggest undeveloped piece of land in the
  city. The district today is characterized by its problematic
  mobility infrastructure, the severe environmental pollution
  problems, the accumulation of incompatible land uses and
  its unresolved relation with the downtown of Athens. The
  proposal aims to recognize and strengthen the urban
  identities that have emerged in the area since it was an
  agricultural land. It is an alternative solution to the ongoing
  urban sprawl to the east part of Athens by bringing more
  inhabitants in Eleonas and designing mixed uses, urban
  communities. It solves the problems related to the
  environmental pollution of the area and creates a wellarticulated
  mobility network which would promote public
  transportation. Finally, it reserves the existing road
  infrastructure and the buildings.
