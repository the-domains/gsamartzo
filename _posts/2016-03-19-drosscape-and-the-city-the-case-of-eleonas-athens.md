# Drosscape and the city
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/df5094aaa485c7b3f29d84b4cf1a99b77c14e209.jpg)

This project addresses design strategies for the future development of drosscapes in urban regions and their relation with the city at large, having as an example the district of Eleonas in Athens, Greece. It provides answers to the problems of the district and understands the drosscape as a potential for the urban revitalization of the city of Athens. The design proposal is primarily concerned with the urban transformation of the drosscape, and not its ecological reclamation. To do so, the proposal focuses in multiple scales of analysis and proposals. Eleonas is a huge area covering approximately 2.350 acres. It is located within walking distance from the historical center of Athens, while at the same time it is the biggest undeveloped piece of land in the city. The district today is characterized by its problematic mobility infrastructure, the severe environmental pollution problems, the accumulation of incompatible land uses and its unresolved relation with the downtown of Athens. The proposal aims to recognize and strengthen the urban identities that have emerged in the area since it was an agricultural land. It is an alternative solution to the ongoing urban sprawl to the east part of Athens by bringing more inhabitants in Eleonas and designing mixed uses, urban communities. It solves the problems related to the environmental pollution of the area and creates a wellarticulated mobility network which would promote public transportation. Finally, it reserves the existing road infrastructure and the buildings.
