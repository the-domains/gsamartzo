This project addresses design strategies for the future
development of drosscapes in urban regions and their
relation with the city at large, having as an example the
district of Eleonas in Athens, Greece. It provides answers to
the problems of the district and understands the drosscape
as a potential for the urban revitalization of the city of
Athens. The design proposal is primarily concerned with the
urban transformation of the drosscape, and not its ecological
reclamation. To do so, the proposal focuses in multiple scales
of analysis and proposals. Eleonas is a huge area covering
approximately 2.350 acres. It is located within walking
distance from the historical center of Athens, while at the
same time it is the biggest undeveloped piece of land in the
city. The district today is characterized by its problematic
mobility infrastructure, the severe environmental pollution
problems, the accumulation of incompatible land uses and
its unresolved relation with the downtown of Athens. The
proposal aims to recognize and strengthen the urban
identities that have emerged in the area since it was an
agricultural land. It is an alternative solution to the ongoing
urban sprawl to the east part of Athens by bringing more
inhabitants in Eleonas and designing mixed uses, urban
communities. It solves the problems related to the
environmental pollution of the area and creates a wellarticulated
mobility network which would promote public
transportation. Finally, it reserves the existing road
infrastructure and the buildings.
