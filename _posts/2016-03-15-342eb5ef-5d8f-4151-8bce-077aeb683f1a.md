  This project addresses the design of an elementary school in Athens, Greece.
  The building includes twelve classrooms, a library, a restaurant, office
  spaces and a hall for multiple uses. On the ground floor movements are
  organized with a route that begins on the east side of the plot, and
  continues, covering every classroom, giving shape to the atrium in the middle,
  and finally arriving to the tower, which is used as a canteen. The main
  objective is the formation of an atrium which would directly relate to every
  classroom and function as a gathering space for the children during collective
  activities. Great emphasis is given to the design of the multifunctional
  interspaces of the building, in order to produce meeting places for the
  students and a variety of spaces from the closed, to the semi-open, and
  finally to the open spaces. The school uses the adjacent empty plots of the
  urban web for recreational activities. In the same way, the open spaces of the
  school become multifunctional spaces for the local community during the
  evening. Two main open spaces are designed,. These are the encircled atrium
  and the big open space that has direct relation with the restaurant, the
  library and the inclined terrace of the underground hall of multiple uses. The
  design of the underground hall of multiple uses smoothly defines the
  boundaries between the school and the urban web on the ground level.
