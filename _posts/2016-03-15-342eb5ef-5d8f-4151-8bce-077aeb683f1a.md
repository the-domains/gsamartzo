  This project addresses the design of an elementary school in
  Athens, Greece. The building includes twelve classrooms, a
  library, a restaurant, office spaces and a hall for multiple uses.
  On the ground floor movements are organized with a route
  that begins on the east side of the plot, and continues,
  covering every classroom, giving shape to the atrium in the
  middle, and finally arriving to the tower, which is used as a
  canteen. The main objective is the formation of an atrium
  which would directly relate to every classroom and function
  as a gathering space for the children during collective
  activities. Great emphasis is given to the design of the
  multifunctional interspaces of the building, in order to
  produce meeting places for the students and a variety of
  spaces from the closed, to the semi-open, and finally to the
  open spaces. The school uses the adjacent empty plots of the
  urban web for recreational activities. In the same way, the
  open spaces of the school become multifunctional spaces for
  the local community during the evening. Two main open
  spaces are designed,. These are the encircled atrium and the
  big open space that has direct relation with the restaurant,
  the library and the inclined terrace of the underground hall of
  multiple uses. The design of the underground hall of multiple
  uses smoothly defines the boundaries between the school
  and the urban web on the ground level.
