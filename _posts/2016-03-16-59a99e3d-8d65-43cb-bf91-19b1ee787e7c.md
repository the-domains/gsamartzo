  The spectacular site along Porto's historic Riverfront offers a unique
  opportunity to re-imagine the Douro River promenade, and create an original
  urban experience that establishes new relations with the water element and the
  dramatic topography of Porto. The principal goal was to invent this new
  relation to the water. This is achieved with the “Engraved” Axis, a cut
  through Douro River that divides the new program from the natural water and
  brings the visitor to an under water level. Moreover, the pools that are
  allocated on the other side of this axis enjoy uninterrupted views to the
  river and the city. The proposal forms a new, but also timeless urban
  character for the riverfront by introducing the element of the Arcade. The
  Arcade supports a widened sidewalk at the street level, and offers a covered
  promenade at the water level, while accommodating temporary galleries,
  marketplaces, and utilities, such as restrooms and circulation. The Arcade
  also embodies a linear water tank that collects and filters rain water. The
  proposal aims to develop the waterfront in three phases. The Arcade, the three
  Plazas, and finally the “Engraving Axis”. The promenade is split between a
  permanent construction that is attached to the existing retaining wall, and a
  light, floating deck that accommodates all the uses adjacent to the water.
  While the permanent construction holds the “hard” infrastructure the floating
  part flexibly adjusts to the fluctuating level of the river. This duality also
  offers the possibility for incremental completion of the project through
  consecutive building phases.
