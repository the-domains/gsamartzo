The spectacular site along Porto's historic Riverfront offers a
unique opportunity to re-imagine the Douro River
promenade, and create an original urban experience that
establishes new relations with the water element and the
dramatic topography of Porto. The principal goal was to
invent this new relation to the water. This is achieved with the
"Engraved" Axis, a cut through Douro River that divides the
new program from the natural water and brings the visitor to
an under water level. Moreover, the pools that are allocated
on the other side of this axis enjoy uninterrupted views to the
river and the city. The proposal forms a new, but also timeless
urban character for the riverfront by introducing the element
of the Arcade. The Arcade supports a widened sidewalk at
the street level, and offers a covered promenade at the water
level, while accommodating temporary galleries,
marketplaces, and utilities, such as restrooms and circulation.
The Arcade also embodies a linear water tank that collects
and filters rain water. The proposal aims to develop the
waterfront in three phases. The Arcade, the three Plazas, and
finally the "Engraving Axis". The promenade is split between
a permanent construction that is attached to the existing
retaining wall, and a light, floating deck that accommodates
all the uses adjacent to the water. While the permanent
construction holds the "hard" infrastructure the floating part
flexibly adjusts to the fluctuating level of the river. This
duality also offers the possibility for incremental completion
of the project through consecutive building phases.
