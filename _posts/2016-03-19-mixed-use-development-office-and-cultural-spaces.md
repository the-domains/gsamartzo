Design of a buildings complex which accommodates
multiple different uses. It includes exhibition spaces, a
conference hall, office and seminar spaces, a library and a
restaurant. The main organizational elements of the design
are the atriums, which connect floors that have different
uses. The office spaces and the restaurant are placed on the
front part of the plot in order to have the view of the adjacent
park. The exhibition spaces are organized in an open plan
configuration and are placed away from the adjacent noisy
highway. They are connected with a continuous ramp which
begins at the ground floor and runs through multiple floors.
Great emphasis is given to the integration of the overall
complex in the adjacent urban web. The buildings organize
the pedestrian movements on the ground level, thus,
becoming a passage and an active part of the urban web.
The rotation of the grid in the plan gives the impression of a
formal break and the penetration of one form through
another. The two main uses of the building are expressed
with different construction systems. The metallic structure
accommodates office and seminar spaces. The concrete
structure includes the exhibition spaces and the restaurant.
