  Design of a buildings complex which accommodates
  multiple different uses. It includes exhibition spaces, a
  conference hall, office and seminar spaces, a library and a
  restaurant. The main organizational elements of the design
  are the atriums, which connect floors that have different
  uses. The office spaces and the restaurant are placed on the
  front part of the plot in order to have the view of the adjacent
  park. The exhibition spaces are organized in an open plan
  configuration and are placed away from the adjacent noisy
  highway. They are connected with a continuous ramp which
  begins at the ground floor and runs through multiple floors.
  Great emphasis is given to the integration of the overall
  complex in the adjacent urban web. The buildings organize
  the pedestrian movements on the ground level, thus,
  becoming a passage and an active part of the urban web.
  The rotation of the grid in the plan gives the impression of a
  formal break and the penetration of one form through
  another. The two main uses of the building are expressed
  with different construction systems. The metallic structure
  accommodates office and seminar spaces. The concrete
  structure includes the exhibition spaces and the restaurant.
