Design of a buildings complex which accommodates multiple different uses. It includes exhibition spaces, a conference hall, office and seminar spaces, a library and a restaurant. The main organizational elements of the design are the atriums, which connect floors that have different uses. The office spaces and the restaurant are placed on the front part of the plot in order to have the view of the adjacent park. The exhibition spaces are organized in an open plan configuration and are placed away from the adjacent noisy highway. They are connected with a continuous ramp which begins at the ground floor and runs through multiple floors. Great emphasis is given to the integration of the overall complex in the adjacent urban web. The buildings organize the pedestrian movements on the ground level, thus, becoming a passage and an active part of the urban web. The rotation of the grid in the plan gives the impression of a formal break and the penetration of one form through another. The two main uses of the building are expressed with different construction systems. The metallic structure accommodates office and seminar spaces. The concrete structure includes the exhibition spaces and the restaurant.
