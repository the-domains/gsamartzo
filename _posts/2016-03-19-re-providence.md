Re-Providence

The project aims to develop a dense urban fabric in the center of Providence, Rhode Island and connect it with the adjacent areas, which have been developed according to the suburban sprawl model. The proposal focuses on three different scales. The Urban scale, the Neighborhood scale and finally the Street scale. On the Urban scale, three linear infrastructure axes cross the center of Providence and expand into the suburban areas. These axes organize a sequence of free public spaces together with commercial and recreational uses along them. They become poles of attraction both to the local community and visitors from other areas. The linear infrastructure provides the means for transportation, both for pedestrians and vehicles. On the Neighborhood plan, a small scale urban block typology is applied in the plan, in order to infill the existing urban voids and create new walk able neighborhoods. Three street typologies are used in the plan. Great emphasis is given to the pedestrian street network which connects the public spaces. The street scale proposal includes the design of the buildings' facades and the guidelines for their overall dimensions and number of built floors, in order to create a unified experience of urban space. The master plan reconstructs the city center and aims to reform the surrounding suburbia in the future. It accommodates 15.000 more inhabitants in the city center than the existing plan.
